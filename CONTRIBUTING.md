# Contributing to COBOL Banking System

This project uses the **Forge Protocol AI-Only Development Model** ([ADR-011](https://github.com/royalbit/forge-protocol/blob/main/docs/adr/011-ai-only-development-no-external-prs.md)).

## Why No Pull Requests?

This project is developed by an autonomous AI following the Forge Protocol. External PRs are an attack vector that could bypass ethics safeguards.

**Trust Model:**

Human Owner -> AI (autonomous) -> Tests Pass -> Direct Commit -> Main
```
