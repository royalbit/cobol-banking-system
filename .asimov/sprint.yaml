  blockers: []

  notes: |
    Milestone v0.2.0 complete. BankingService implements all COBOL operations:

    COBOL → Java mapping:
    - CREATE-ACCOUNT → createAccount()
    - VIEW-ACCOUNTS → getAllAccounts()
    - DEPOSIT-MONEY → deposit() + logTransaction(DEPOSIT)
    - WITHDRAW-MONEY → withdraw() + logTransaction(WITHDRAWAL)
    - APPLY-INTEREST → applyInterest() + logTransaction(INTEREST)
    - DELETE (soft) → deleteAccount() + logTransaction(DELETE)

    Validation matches COBOL:
    - Overdraft prevention: IF BALANCE >= WS-AMOUNT
    - Inactive account rejection
    - Name padding to 30 chars (PIC X(30))

    Test coverage:
    - 27 new service tests
    - 33 domain/fixture tests
    - Total: 60 tests passing

    Ready for v0.3.0: Transaction logging & mini statements.
