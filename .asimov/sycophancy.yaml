# IMPORTANT: This is a CORE PROTOCOL, not optional configuration.
# Anti-sycophancy is a non-negotiable principle of the Asimov Protocol.
#
# Philosophy: User trust requires honest feedback, not comfortable lies.
#             Disagreement is respect. Flattery is disrespect.

# Protocol: https://github.com/royalbit/asimov-protocol
