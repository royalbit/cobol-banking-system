mission:
  problem: |
    Banks run $3 trillion on COBOL with aging workforce.
    Migration is risky, expensive, and poorly understood.
  solution: |
    AI-assisted COBOL to Java migration with Asimov Protocol.
    Demonstrates autonomous legacy modernization.
  success_metric: "Complete migration with test parity"

migration_patterns:
  cobol_to_java:
    - "WORKING-STORAGE → class fields"
    - "PERFORM → method calls"
    - "MOVE → assignment"
    - "COMPUTE → arithmetic expressions"
    - "PIC 9(n)V9(m) → BigDecimal"
  testing:
    - "Same test cases as COBOL"
    - "Identical outputs required"
